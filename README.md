[Cody](https://about.sourcegraph.com/cody) is an AI coding assistant developed by Sourcegraph. One of the cool features of Cody are commands which are pre-defined prompts with a set of context that the developers can directly apply to their code. This repository consists of curated lists of custom commands which can be used with Cody.
